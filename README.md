# TuringStarWars
The http://www.asciimation.co.nz/ ASCII Star Wars rewritten in Turing.

## Details
This is a clone of the original ASCII Star Wars rewritten in Turing.<br>
The film file was created by extracting it from the original website, replacing all '\n's with their real newlines and unescaping it.<br>
I wrote the program myself. The program is also heavily commented so learners can understand what the heck is going on.<br>
The program also prints out some minor debugging information but does not support speed changes and pausing like the web version does.

## Note
Turing is not a fast language so the animation may lag on some slower computers, I'm sure it could be optimized however.
